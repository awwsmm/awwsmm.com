description: 'Rewriting My Personal Website in Next.js and TypeScript'
---

New Year's Day is as good a time as any to roll out a new blog, I suppose.

As one of my New Year's Resolutions this year, I'm going to revamp my website, and I'm going to do it in public.

I've spent the last few weeks working with Next.js for the first time (and brushing up on my TypeScript) in order to start hosting my technical blog on my own website. (In addition to mirroring the posts [on Dev.to](https://dev.to/awwsmm), where I've been writing for a few years now.)

In addition to the ol' blog, I've also created **/project** pages for a few ongoing things I've got in the works (including this very website). The project pages synthesize groups of commits from GitHub with manual "update" log posts to give an idea as to the current status of each of my ongoing projects. I think this is a bit more dynamic than a static "portfolio" page, and it reflects a tenet of my own personal philosophy that [_un ouvrage n’est jamais achevé... mais abandonné_](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/01/abandon/).

Follow along here, [on Dev.to](https://dev.to/awwsmm), or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/awwsmm_dot_com) for continuing updates.

Thanks for reading!
