## Recent Changes

There's a big gap in the commit history for this website.

On March 17, 2022, I added [a new blog post](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/f0824e094b89dcf4acb0ec8b02ed79de72bb0eb9). You can read the post, titled ["Elegant Multi-Line Shell Strings"](https://www.awwsmm.com/blog/elegant-multi-line-shell-strings), here if you like.

Then, I made no changes for almost an entire year. I merged two dependency updates in [January 2023](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/8c44b9d826a72051f266b0f978b23293d4928a77) and [February 2023](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/8c7d627562ac7d476307e1bc14c2f1132db566e4). The next substantial changes I made were [on March 3, 2023](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/compare/8c7d627562ac7d476307e1bc14c2f1132db566e4...1a9879460df80b23a770326f3e22e5c34d9624b5), where I bumped a few dependencies and rewrote a bit of the codebase which had always bothered me / felt a bit clunky to me.

Over the past two months, though, I've been on a roll. I

- added new [`/blog` and `/projects` "home" pages](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/6120cbd7e83fe23d7371d541b2b46ed556477799)
- [configured Dependabot](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/77a247259be66eb2fb97bd834bf2625c66e86a7f) to keep my dependencies up to date
- [learned a bit of GraphQL](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/f6260bbc9bd1d181fbf3f613a73008f1cfe53e4c), using it to minimize the amount of data I request from GitHub
- [wrote a new blog post](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/d6f9309fce056d8aef741fbf7dc4e5e7f9f8c12f) about my experience trying to keep the project pages up to date

I also [organized my to-do list](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/9818c5a61429f80fdbbfd241819e33896ad8dce7), crossing off lots of small things which had been sitting there for a while, like

- [adding my old favicon back](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/0ab63bfb72cfcfd8f01370f5c3325690ec9a0763)
- [making code blocks less ugly](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/f5c22e448beaf7f0fc402ee827cbe938f8f993b6)
- [linking to interactive demos](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/932fe4bef5319e66bf63e61a7b5c24dc34e62618) on project pages

...not to mention all of the small quality-of-life development fixes I've added: restructuring the code for ease of maintenance, upgrading dependencies, clarifying docs, and just generally making my development workflow a lot easier. (I've still [got a lot to do](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/issues), but I'm making good progress.)

I then ported over some old blog posts from [my Dev.To](https://dev.to/awwsmm) blog to test the [new Markdown rendering and CSS](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/8d5c08f846bda031f34031387fad807f10b9c5d6) I added, and to have some data for [Vercel analytics](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/f599298058d9d13fd8255e108b90ca277ea56dcd). These are some of the posts I'm most proud of, including

- ["20 Intriguing, Unusual, and Goofy Programming Languages"](https://www.awwsmm.com/blog/20-intriguing-unusual-and-goofy-programming-languages)
- ["Managing Your Python Project with Git and PyBuilder"](https://www.awwsmm.com/blog/managing-your-python-project-with-git-and-pybuilder), and
- ["101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts"](https://www.awwsmm.com/blog/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts)

Finally, I also added [social buttons](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/540cefdd7bf136ca91c9ab01b3b832d88dfb05b3) to the bottom of blog posts to make them easier to share, and set log entries on project pages to [collapse when they're at the bottom of the project update history](https://github.com/awwsmm/awwsmm.com/commit/e95822a7342eacaf62683d1066e271af5e5d768b), because I've now got too many commits and my last log entry for awwsmm.com is all the way at the bottom of the page -- the victim of my own productivity.

## Roadblocks

March 2022 to March 2023 was a busy time for me. I left my job, moved out of Ireland, got married, went on a two-month honeymoon road trip around the U.S., moved to Canada, started a new job, and survived my first Canadian winter. It's only now that I'm really starting to recover from all of that, and starting to have a good chunk of time to work on my website again.

But that being said, before all of those big life changes happened, I had set the bar very high for myself to keep this website up to date. It was definitely over-engineered. Cleaning up the confusing stuff, removing roadblocks, and making the path to developing and writing straighter and smoother have led to a huge number of improvements over the past few months.

I hope to keep that momentum going with more log entries, blog posts, and project updates in the coming months. Stay tuned!
