This is an example log entry.

It's just a placeholder until other "update" log entries are available.

I'm using it to test the rendering and ordering of these updates, which are written in _markdown_, just like the blog posts.

Here is some **other markdown stuff** so I can see how it's [rendered](https://www.google.com)
- some stuff
- some more stuff
- additional stuff

## A Level-2 Heading

Some content

# A Level-1 Heading

Some more content

> And this is a blockquote

```
// And this is a code block
const answer = 42;
```
